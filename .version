v5.1:
  -minor bugs fixes

v5:
  features:
  - Added support for OSX default (or other OS's with md5 as default)
  - Removed need for ~/.kode directory (manually delete this if a previous version has run)
  - Locally run without install or sudo:
        alias kode="\"$PWD/kode\""
      or add:
        alias kode="<path_to_kode>/kode"
      to your ~/.bashrc file, substituting in the full path

  tech debt:
  - Rehaul of the overall flow, making adding new templates easier
  - Using getopts for arg parsing
  - Added debugging for quickly iterating through example files
  - Added config dump (flag '-d') for debugging
  - Moved version info to a separate file
  - Reduced duplication and setting things in multiple places
  - Added an alert for non-scripting language files that don't have an available template
